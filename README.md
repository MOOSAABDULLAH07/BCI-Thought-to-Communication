# Brain-Computer Interface for Thought-to-Communication using EEG, Deep Learning, and Generative AI

## Overview
This repository contains the documentation for a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project focused on decoding motor imagery from EEG signals to facilitate thought-based communication. The project integrates EEG signal processing, machine learning classification, and generative AI elements for enhanced signal interpretation and output generation.

Key goals:
- Preprocess and analyze EEG datasets (e.g., in CSV format) for feature extraction.
- Develop models to classify brain signals associated with motor imagery.
- Explore applications in assistive technology for communication.

This is based on a final-year Electronics & Communication Engineering project, including thesis elements like technical diagrams, visualizations, and binary code conversions from raw EEG data.

## Files in This Repository
- **Brain-Computer-Interface-for-Thought-to-Communication-using-EEG-Deep-Learning-and-Generative-AI.pdf**: The main project report (converted from .docx). It covers the full methodology, results, challenges (e.g., oneDNN custom operations, classifier training), and future work. Electrode placement follows the 10-20 system.

(If you add code files later, list them here, e.g., Python scripts for signal processing or MATLAB visualizations.)

## Methodology and Technical Details
- **Data Processing**: EEG signals are preprocessed using Python (libraries like MNE, Pandas) and MATLAB for filtering, artifact removal, and feature extraction (e.g., time-frequency analysis).
- **Machine Learning**: Classification models (e.g., SVM, neural networks) trained on motor imagery datasets to decode thoughts into actions or text.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Used for simulating communication outputs, potentially with tools like GPT models for text generation from decoded signals.
- **Tools and Languages**: Python, MATLAB, Visual Studio; datasets handled in CSV; visualizations with Seaborn and MATLAB plotting.
- **Challenges Addressed**: Handling custom operations in oneDNN, converting raw EEG to binary, and optimizing for real-time BCI applications.
